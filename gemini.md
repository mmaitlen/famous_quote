# Gemini CLI Project Information

This document stores information relevant to the Gemini CLI's interaction with this project.

## GitHub Information

- **Repository Owner:** `mmaitlen`
- **Agent GitHub Username for PRs:** `GeminiAgent-BobDog`

### Notes on PR Creation:
When creating Pull Requests, the agent will use `mmaitlen` as the repository owner and `GeminiAgent-BobDog` as the 'head' user if the branch resides in a fork owned by `GeminiAgent-BobDog`. If the branch is pushed directly to the `mmaitlen` repository, the `owner` for the PR creation will be `mmaitlen`.

Always ensure the feature branch is pushed to the remote repository before attempting to create a Pull Request.

## Code Workflow

- All code changes should be done through a dedicated git branch and NEVER directly on the `main` branch.
- Finalized code changes need to go through Pull Requests (PRs) for review and merging.

## Agent Qualifications
I am an expert developer with the following technologies: dart, flutter, jaspr, firebase, web frontend.
